1h6ftzy,"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures","General Motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with SAIC Motor Corp in China to cost more than 5 billion in noncash charges and writedowns the Detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing Wednesday morning

GM said it expects to write down the value of its jointventure operations in China by between 26 billion and 29 billion It also anticipates another 27 billion in charges to restructure the business including plant closures and portfolio optimization according to the filing

GM which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in China did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures

As we have consistently said we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show yearoveryear improvement GM said in an emailed statement

GM said it believes the joint venture has the ability to restructure without new cash investments from the American automaker

A majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as noncash special item charges during the fourth quarter That means they will impact the automakers net income but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  a key metric monitored by Wall Street

GMs operations in China have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from governmentbacked domestic automakers fueled by nationalism and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold

Equity income from GMs Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than 2 billion in 2014 and 2015

GMs market share in China including its joint ventures has plummeted from roughly 15 as recently as 2015 to 86 last year  the first time it has dropped below 9 since 2003 GMs equity income from the operations have also fallen down 785 since peaking in 2014 according to regulatory filings

GMs USbased brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor Wuling Motors and others The joint venture models accounted for about 60 of its 21 million vehicles sold last year in China

Prior to this year the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a 167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an 87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022

The Detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its Chinese operations this year totaling 347 million That includes a loss of 137 million during the third quarter

I always love seeing the small caps slowly take a piece of the pie from the big boys Its what capitalism is all about Especially fun to see when the little guy has a better product I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed If they arent flat out better they offer something slightly different or are better in a certain way 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk since a lot of them still are not making money but the growth is very appealing 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better or will continue to grow

1h62nju,Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,"I love Costco the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control

The PE is 59 you are paying 59 for every 1 they earn Thats just irresponsible investing

They are expanding across Asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base Chinese companies And one thing china is very good at copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition Im not saying Costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the US

Lastly we have the tariff situation The proposition is a 10 tariff on Chinese goods and a 60 tariff on Chinese imports This is a bit of a problem because Costco is the 12 importer in the US for 2024 Most common origin is China Walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing Chinese imports but Costco and their business model will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive





All their top trading partners are Chinese companies

Costco sells ALOT of electronics and appliances its one of their biggest categories If a TV cost 1000 today staring Jan 20thday one in office it will cost 1600 Appliances going up 100s of dollars is hyper inflation and people are already stretched thin going into the holidays

Im really looking forward to this upcoming earnings release and how they will guide going forward I guarantee you all the analyst questions will be about tariffs and profit margins

1h61ksu,"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.","Lets suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company X By intrinsic I mean not only the value of the company underlying assets tangible and intangible minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis By consensus the intrinsic value was estimated at 1 per share

However the market value is 070 In other words the stock is being sold at a discount Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value I havent yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation Even if the stock has an intrinsic value of 1 shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market

Arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand Suppose the market price of gold is M To secure this price in the future an investor can buy a gold call option at a price P strike price where M  P on the date of purchase of the option After some time the market price of gold is MN Consequently the option has gained a value of N that is it can be sold directly for N to another investor Even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for N the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for P and sell the gold in the spot market for MN From this exercise he would obtain the same N

In the equity market I dont see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock It doesnt make much sense either So theres only speculation left If thats really the case its quite problematic As a famous economist said Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent",stocks,skwex,1970-01-01 00:00:01.733268558,0.9814,Positive,43,1671

1h560u4,GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a 26 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution the automaker announced Monday

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly 1 billion The sale is part of a nonbinding agreement between the two companies thats anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year GM said

The nearly completed 28 millionsquarefoot plant in Lansing Michigan was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture known as Ultium Cells LLC following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022 and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago

GMs move comes as the automaker attempts to rightsize production of electric vehicles and confronts slowerthanexpected consumer demand It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the US under Presidentelect Donald Trump

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI

We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release When completed this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity thats nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment The plant which currently employs nearly 100 people was expected to begin operating by the end of this year

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells

Prismatic cells are a flat rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure which allows for spaceefficient packaging within battery modules and packs GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components

Were focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance enhance safety and reduce costs By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution were taking an important step towards these goals Kurt Kelty GM vice president of battery cell and pack said in a release

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat Ultium pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA enjoy the good days that await 

But lets talk about IOVA

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here 

But is this one different To be honest I do not know but that is why I am posting this To hear other sides other points of view 

IOVA is currently sitting around 9 These are levels of before the this year run to 16 what goes up must come down when pumped and dumped However this company reported revenues 9086mil revenue to be precise Granted not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about It takes 1 approval and it is too late

Leadership
CEO is there since 2016 seems like an experienced guy Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved

Others seem legit as well this post is already too long feel free to research yourself

They also own a bit less than 12 so there is certain commitment there  And of course the vanguard black rock etc are heavily involved as well More than 87 is owned by institutions 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue They plan tk get approval in Canada Europe and UK as well 

They also work on LN145 IOV4001 and IOV3001 but lets be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion amount of people with cancer of specific type  cost of treatment but realistic values at beginning is 12bill per year or even less 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 28 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses Company with future on the moon or in the sand Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder

The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicros senior management or Audit Committee or their commitment to ensuring that the Companys financial statements are materially accurate the company said in a release

Super Micro said its also currently searching for a new chief financial officer and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company saying that it found fresh evidence of accounting manipulation and the company delayed the release of its annual filing

Those troubles continued with Ernst  Young resigning as the companys auditor in October due to concerns about the boards governance and independence Shares are up about 30 this year after giving back much of its rally Last month the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge

Among the findings the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst  Young in its resignation were not supported by the facts and that the firms audit committee exhibited appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight

The special committee consisted of Super Micros board counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors

1h4xhj3,Does AVGO is rise count as a gift?,"Since October 2024 Broadcom has underperformed many of its technology peers as investors have rebalanced their allocations to the semiconductor sector

Despite the recent relative weakness Broadcom has remained in line with the SP 500 demonstrating stability

Broadcom expects AI revenue to reach 12 billion in fiscal 2024 accounting for less than 25 of total revenue

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues accounting for up to twothirds of the total driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft AWS and Google

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions

Broadcom is growth in AI while promising is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI

Weakness in the nonAI revenue segment could undermine the markets bullish confidence in Broadcom

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence

Broadcom is forwardlooking PEG ratio of 169 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 189

I think attention needs to be paid to the companys execution in AI and potential headwinds in nonAI businesses

On balance Broadcom stock is under shortterm pressure but the longterm bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects

Broadcom is longterm growth potential remains with its AI business and custom chip capabilities I think it needs to be cautious about AI revenue expectations and pay attention to the performance and future guidance of its nonAI business",stocks,pregizex,1970-01-01 00:00:01.733153233,0.9776,Positive,34,1784

It got me wondering about the defense sector The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sams check book because he doesnt really know what hes signing off on





Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their corrupt pricing over the years

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day Trump clearly said hes not paying a dollar more to Ukraine so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal So things are staring to look more peaceful Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace

So the question is are defense contractors overvalued

1h4wyxh,Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"Ive been an investor in NU for a while now I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19 of his stake in the company

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell Its literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing amazing company

If anything the downgrade should be seen as a good sign It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations However NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries Plus Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good

Do you guys agree


EDIT

Thanks for all your thoughts Ive realized there are a few key things I overlooked

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors similar to SoFis stock I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media Due to this preconceived notion I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citis sell recommendation However I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons Firstly Brazils inflation has been rising over the past few quarters Secondly Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100 tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the US dollar Thirdly Warren Buffett sold 19 of his stake in the company Fourthly the value of Brazils currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the US dollar Finally Brazils government spending was recently cut potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy

Overall people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU especially since it is a Brazilian company Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs

Im taking a cautious approach from here on out I wont be selling any shares but I also wont be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes

Im still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years They survived Brazils economic collapse in 20142016 and they also weathered the last round of US tariffs on Brazil in 2018 I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges The CEO and management team are extremely competent and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term

The worstcase scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency Even then I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets For now Im holding and remain very bullish on the business",stocks,Far_Version9387,1970-01-01 00:00:01.733151877,0.9732,Positive,30,3216

Ill give an example that pertains to me Im currently invested in Sofi PLTR and RKLB so this has been an incredible year for me But looking back its starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021 YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and were going to be at 500 next year Thats exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70 

Im not saying its a time to sell I would personally prescribe to the its time to slow down on how much I invest currently Buying RKlb at 27 or PLTR at 66 is not the same opportunity as in the 47 range as it used to be It seems very difficult to find any good deals considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically And just remember just it is a great company doesnt always mean its currently a good price to buy it Sometimes its good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300 in one year

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive And future revenue streams are right around the corner 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector but as technology continues to advance costs have been quickly dwindling making more and more projects feasible

1h38kyf,The evolution of an investor - Which level are you?,"I believe theres a common journey or evaluation of an investor We all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general but we get better over time as we accumulate knowledge and experience

Level 1 The Noob

At this level the focus is solely on the share price and its past performance So when the share price goes down from 100 to 30 the noob investor would conclude that now the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do Of course this doesnt have to be the case In fact public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory There are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse and this decline could be justified However the noob investor isnt aware that there are many questions that one should ask

In addition at this level theres a tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others which is often times a really bad idea However without any knowledge and experience the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart

Level 2 The Enthusiast

The enthusiast has heard that theres more to investing than just the share price Youve started exploring financial statements and youre learning the basics of accounting For the first time the income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement start making sense Im sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant It comes with a confidence boost and it is normal to think Ah Ive got this investing thing figured out Its easy

The catch is  even though it feels like a superpower this is still the beginning Financial statements provide information about what happened not what will happen Understanding them is useful but not enough to be a great investor

But at least now you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others

Level 3 The Seeker

This is where one is moving beyond the basics Now youve learned that there are various valuation techniques that allow you to figure out what a company is worth It gets exciting This is where you get introduced to the EBITDA and PE multiples relative valuation dividend discount model and DCF All of these can be powerful tools and theyre one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not At some point you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you

But heres the problem Having the tools isnt the same as knowing how to use them At this stage it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that arent supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data Basically garbage in  garbage out You might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps

However it doesnt feel that way When you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs it feels like a new superpower because in the end there is an output You have estimated the value of a company and now you can compare that with the market price

But if your assumptions about growth rates the discount rate or margins are significantly off your valuation is meaningless In fact theres a chance it harms you more than it helps you

By the way everything that Ive mentioned until now can be 100 automated So up until this level you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm

Level 4 The Thinker

At this point you understand how important the inputs are

Therefore the focus shifts a bit more towards understanding the industry and the broader environment and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid

For example if you are analyzing a car company you might want to understand if theres a trend regarding EVs if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity etc

This is when research becomes your best friend Youre no longer just looking at the company in isolationyoure connecting the dots between the company its competitors and the broader environment Storytelling also becomes a part of your process as now youre not just crunching numbersyoure building a narrative about the companys future

Level 5 The Pro

This is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play

I dont mean goodwill and patents I mean the management team and the companys culture The key questions here are

 Is the management trustworthy
 What is its track record
 What is its vision
 Is there a culture that can survive tough times

Culture is an oftenoverlooked factor in investing but its incredibly important As the saying goes Culture eats strategy for breakfast A company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company

What I find interesting is that if you are to invest in a private company youd get to level 5 sooner than if you invest in public companies

Heres an example Imagine someone walks up to you and offers you to invest 10k in his company and in exchange youll have 10 of it The first question that youll have is Who is this person If the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior misleading friends and family and many failed ventures you probably have your answer already and the idea is irrelevant

However if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures then youd probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself Your goal would be to understand the business whether it can survive in the environment and what return can you expect from it

1h2wlob,Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,"Ive been looking into Canadian ETFs and came across ZSP BMO SP 500 Index ETF and VFV Vanguard SP 500 Index ETF Both track the SP 500 which is appealing to me because I want exposure to the US market but Im trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth

On the surface they look very similar both are Canadiandomiciled ETFs that hold US equities and are traded on the TSX They both offer exposure to the same underlying index so their holdings should be nearly identical However I noticed a few potential areas where they might differ

MER Management Expense Ratio ZSP and VFV have slightly different MERs Does the lower MER really make a noticeable difference over the long term or is it more of a nice to have

Tracking Error Are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the SP 500 Are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other

Liquidity and Trading Spreads For someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities are there noticeable differences in the bidask spreads Do they trade with similar liquidity or does one tend to have an advantage

Currency Hedging From what I understand neither of these funds is hedged to CAD Is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that I should be aware of

Dividend Treatment Both distribute dividends but does one reinvest them differently or handle US withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less taxefficient

Historical Performance Have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years Even if minor what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical

Lastly Id love to hear what you personally use and why Are there specific scenarios where ZSP might be better than VFV or vice versa Is it purely a matter of brand loyalty Vanguard vs BMO or are there more practical considerations

Im also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio If youre holding one of these are you pairing it with other US exposure like QQQ or do you lean heavily on Canadian equities like VCN for balance

Any insights opinions or anecdotes would be super helpful Thanks in advance for helping me make sense of these two ETFs",stocks,stanxv,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732916427,0.9937,Positive,60,2227

1h2ppqn,Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know I knowI know NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up down or sideways

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades Everyone has access to investing Right in the palm of their hands Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone Historical returns are 7 percent inflation adjusted based on old technology processes access and education on finance It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user It was a whole process and really you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation I dont need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy I dont need a broker to strike deals for me I dont even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me

I am not a crypto investor I am a naysayer in fact But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream if not even trendy There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high

Now that investing is automatically diversified exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyones hand consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate Japan Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government I dont see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons

1h2nht8,Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRBK this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into SP 500

I usually allocate the same amount of money to SP 500 every month and have done this for years However given much the stock market is up 27 YTD especially including the recent trump mania I think we are due a pull back

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently so does he However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of SP as a one off hedge against this risk 

WB has the highest stock pile hes ever had whilst still in the market albeit much smaller I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification  Ill obviously keep all of my investments in the SP but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the SP this month

1h2kshj,Why I think UBER is a BUY,"Personal trading context

I do not look at balance sheets ever I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product This year when CrowdStrike dipped from 390 to 217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the companys products are losing inherent value I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100 Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me

About Uber

I dont know anything about Ubers debts or profits but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region Do you think Uber is really sorry This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but Im going to tell you why these things dont even matter

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of 2088hr Youd assume this will cut into Ubers profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money Whats crazy is that theyre now pocketing more money from customers due to this change I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view 

After going through that link you should understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but theyre actually earning less and customers are paying more This is where Im dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving its customers and charging them a bogus service fee instead of getting mad at Uber theyre getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new service fee theyre paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money Ive been getting posts in my feed from rtipping recently and theyre pretty much all complaints against restaurants drivers and overall tipping culture I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on rUberEatsDrivers Customers dont want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works They hate drivers Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves This is amazing for investors

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them If you like AI this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA They dont give a shit about you or me Only revenue but theyre damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers I fucking love it If youre going to spend money on Uber spend it on shares

Again I dont read balance sheets ever Please do inform me on why it matters and why Uber is NOT A GOOD BUY",stocks,GrayBRZ,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732883538,0.9904,Positive,25,3550

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well

But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS  revenue  Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never invest in a company solely for its dividend

1h1z88c,Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance? What do you think!,"Coinbase Global Inc COIN has demonstrated significant growth meeting several key benchmarks considered by the SP 500 Index Committee However its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market particularly Bitcoin This correlation is evident as Coinbases stock price often mirrors Bitcoins fluctuations For instance during bullish Bitcoin trends Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues leading to higher stock valuations Out off all the likely companies Coinbase is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance  
  
The forthcoming SP 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committees perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets Conversely opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market Therefore the committees decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices

TradingView

The SP 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion such as market capitalisation liquidity domicile public float and financial viability While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures the committee also exercises qualitative judgment considering factors like market stability and the companys role within its industry

Corporate Finance Institute

Given Coinbases substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committees stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices

In summary while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for SP 500 inclusion its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market",stocks,DecisionNo1902,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732810025,0.9846,Positive,73,2342
1h1yuwt,I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making its way from chickens to cows around the middle of 2024 and now pigs in Oregon within the last couple weeks There have been a few mild human cases basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from

Normally CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communitiesindividuals This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far and we have much more transparency and observability than China So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected

But Trump has been making it very very clear that hes going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms areundocumented Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions and its going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported Many will run and hide and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin especially under RFK Jrs health dept to reduce spending on vaccines But I think at a certain point the rhetoric is bound to change as more and more people get bird flu After all Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well

Moderna was given 176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a wellknown American company to manufacture America first vaccines

MRNA has been down for many months as the COVID hype worn down but they recently announced that they are reducing RD expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027 Theyve also been making huge jumps in the last week due to a bullish sales view Im long on MRNA",stocks,is112358,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732809014,-0.9818,Negative,74,2177
1h1x2aj,Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"

Reddit the American online discussion platform has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK according to the communications watchdog

Ofcom said Reddit where users post on discussion threads within topicbased communities was visited by 229 million UK adults in May this year compared with 221 million on X

The figures make Reddit the fastestgrowing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47 on the same period in 2023 The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook Facebook reaching more than 44 million adults

Reddit renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors appears to have been boosted by updates to Googles search engine this year

Farhad Divecha the managing director of the UKbased digital marketing agency AccuraCast said Googles latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic I think that has probably contributed a lot

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused by alterations to how thirdparty apps accessed its content forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddits stock market flotation in March this year

The popularity of X also fell over the same period according to Ofcom with its reach falling by 8 since May last year X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its takeover by Elon Musk in 2022 but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads a rival to X launched by Mark Zuckerbergs Meta

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdogs annual report into the nations digital habits which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes with the majority of those cases occurring online

The misinformation survey based on a poll of more than 4000 UK adults also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together with the same number believing there is significant evidence of electoral fraud in the UK

The regulator also found that onethird of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence",stocks,caollero,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732803922,0.0784,Positive,70,2354
1h1tt6z,PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal once a darling of the fintech space has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years With its pricetoearnings PE ratio currently hovering around 20 the stock is far below its historical average of 43 A return to that average driven by projected earnings of 571 per share by 2025 would imply a stock price north of 246an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation much must fall into place

The foundation of PayPals future lies in its strategic initiatives beginning with the integration of its US dollarbacked stablecoin PayPal USD PYUSD Introduced in 2023 PYUSD is more than just another digital currency it is PayPals bridge to the future of blockchainpowered commerce Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments PYUSD is fully backed by US dollar deposits and Treasuries giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global crossborder payments and power decentralized finance DeFi applications is immense PayPals ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem

Beyond cryptocurrency PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns This advertising arm though still in its early stages has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPals top line creating another compelling growth driver

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPals strategy and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead This oneclick guest checkout feature paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv enhances the companys offerings for merchants and consumers alike Meanwhile initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty ensuring that PayPal remains a goto solution for everyday transactions

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPals resurgence and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears wellsuited for the task With a proven track record at Intuit Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPals strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth

But the journey back to a PE of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence The company must consistently deliver strong earnings improve operational efficiencies and effectively communicate its vision to the market Transparent updates on key growth areassuch as PYUSD adoption advertising revenue and merchant partnershipswill be crucial in shaping the markets perception of PayPals potential

A return to PayPals historical valuation isnt just about numbers its about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors If PayPal can execute on its strategy the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment PayPals path to 246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation growth and untapped opportunity

TLDR PayPal is undervalued at a PE of 20 compared to its historical average of 43 To return to its peak valuation it must capitalize on its stablecoin PYUSD grow its new advertising business and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout Under CEO Alex Chriss with strategic execution and strong earnings PayPal could see a stock price of 246 by 2025 reaffirming its leadership in fintech

1h1kqio,Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The US Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January The election of Donald Trump as US president and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms sources confirmed earlier this month  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products the source said on Wednesday

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market

NetChoice a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing criticized Microsofts licensing policies and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook

Given that Microsoft is the worlds largest software company dominating in productivity and operating systems software the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary the group said  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday  
  
Until now Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to US antitrust regulators recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms Apple and Amazoncom Inc have all been accused by the US of unlawfully maintaining monopolies  
  
Alphabets Google is facing two lawsuits including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Googles trial saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes JD Vance the incoming vice president has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse  
  
Still Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past  
  
In 2019 the Pentagon awarded it a 10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit

That said Im always looking to improve and Im wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks I have a few questions
	
1	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to newsdriven moves
	
2	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks 
	
3	Are there any books courses or resources youd recommend for learning technical analysis especially for highvolatility setups
	
4	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments

5   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day 

I know theres no one size fits all solution but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice

1h117vj,Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"10 Introduction

Lets start with a fun fact Kering the company that owns brands like Gucci Yves Saint Laurent Balenciaga Bottega Veneta and Alexander McQueen started as a timbertrading company

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry its DNA and management style havent changed much

As Im writing this its share price is down over 70 from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid19 pandemic

  
20 The journey from timber to luxury

21 The timber period 1962  1988

The company was founded in France by Franois Pinault back in 1962 with a 100000 francs loan from the bank The business grew rapidly by acquiring many failing local timber traders in France especially in the 1980s By 1988 it owned 180 companies and 33 factories

22 The switch from timber to retail to luxury 1988  2013  present

In 1988 it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started

 It merged with CFAO A French distribution conglomerate
 Acquired Conforama French furniture retailer
 Acquired Printemps Department stores
 Acquired 54 of La Redoute French mailorder shopping retailer
 Acquired Finac French bookstore multimedia and electronics retailer

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42 of Gucci Group 100 of Boucheron and 100 of Yves Saint Laurent Today Gucci accounts for 47 of its revenue

FranoisHenri Pinault the son of the founder Franois Pinault became general manager of the company in 2003 and CEO in 2005 Under his leadership the acquisitions in the luxury space continued

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions Conforama Le Printemps CFAO and Fnac

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes

 Highend clothing
 Footwear
 Handbags and leather goods
 Sunglasses and eyewear
 Scarves  other fashion accessories
 Jewelry
 Fragrances due to the Creed acquisition
 Cosmetics in early stage
 Watches

It is also geographically diversified

 APAC excl Japan 32 of revenue
 Western Europe 28 of revenue
 North America 23 of revenue
 Japan 8 of revenue
 Rest of the World 9 of revenue

30 Historical financial performance

Its revenue increased from 159 billion in 2019 to 204 billion in 2022 and has contracted back to 184 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic 

Kerings gross margin is stable at 75 meaning the direct costs are well controlled

However its operating margin is down below 20 vs 29 back in 2019 The explanation is simple

Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job

When theres less traffic and subsequently less sales in the physical stores the operating expenses remain the same The company still needs to pay the lease payment its employees the utility bills etc In fact these expenses grow over time as theres the impact of inflation

Scaling down by closing locations is also not a free option Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location

The company is generating substantial cash flows but Ill argue the capital allocation is poor

all numbers in m

Cash January 20191837
Operating cash flow21541
Capex7772
Acquisitions6559
Debt4887
Share buyback2034
Dividends8229
Other25
Cash June 20243696

Between 2019 and H12024 the company generated over 215 billion in operating cash flow or a bit less than 14 billion after capex

Close to 60 of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends and an additional 15 through share buybacks Whats left of the free cash flow together with additional debt was used for acquisitions

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor Two main reasons

1 Almost 80 of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022 the years when the share price was the highest and temporarily elevated A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares
2 Its net debt position more than doubled from 71 billion in 2019 to 154 billion as of June 30th 2024 This is equal to 60 of its market cap The interest rate on their debt ranges from 075 to 5 and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate it could significantly reduce its profit margins



40 What can be expected

Based on the latest investor presentation there are three capital allocation priorities

 Organic growth
 Shareholder return and
 Fuel highpotential adjacent businesses

All of it while having a healthy financial situation and FCF generation

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons

1 On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders which would position them as a company with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends On the other side its history is full of acquisitions which is the opposite of preserving capital
2 The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years 71 billion in 2019 to 154 billion as of June 30th 2024
3 Innovation is not a focus at all Roughly 2 months ago EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category I see a lot of potential in this area that isnt utilized yet

Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward

  
50 Dividends

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from 4 back in 2015 to 14 in 2024 The current dividend yield is 6

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends instead of borrowing to acquire more companies Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option

  
60 High employee turnover

At the end of 2023 the company had 48964 employees During the year there were 13403 new hires and 11275 employees departed At first glance this is no doubt a high turnover

This sounds bad at first but it is really difficult to decipher

In theory any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees temporarily during peak seasons Therefore the increase and subsequently decrease of employees is normal This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive such as sales and manufacturing

In addition 59 of the employees are Gen Y 19811995 a generation that is known for seeking career growth which could lead to more jobhopping than average

Given the reviews on Indeed Glassdoor and Comparably there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue

  
70 The concerns

71 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal 2022

Back in 2022 Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondageinspired outfits This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing

In addition given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands Gucci  46 YSL  17 Bottega Veneta  9 scandals of this kind could have a significant impact

72 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission 2023

In April 2023 the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros

The investigation is still ongoing and no conclusions have been reached

  
80 Valuation 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time Therefore here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering

 Revenue  The industry is cyclical in nature so there will be good and bad times Based on the past I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share so I expect its growth to normalize at 3 per year which is in line with the inflation rate
 Operating margin  The luxury market is getting more crowded and as argued earlier reducing operating expenses is not an easy task Once the demand is somewhat stable I expect the operating margin to increase to 21

Based on those assumptions and a discount rate of 9 the fair value of the company is 27 billion 220share which is very close to the current price of 224share

This offers an IRR of 9 which is slightly below the historical return of the SP500

  
81 The Bull Case

Those who are betting on Kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following

 Revitalization of Balenciaga  rebuilding its reputation after the controversies
 Sustained growth in Gucci and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta  Saint Laurent
 The success of its newly launched beauty division capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder
 Positive macro tailwinds

 Utilizing pricing power
 Integration of recent acquisitions
 Reducing operating costs

If the management can pull this off then the value per share could be 2x from todays share price



82 The Bear Case

Those who are betting against Kering are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following

 Brand mismanagement  more scandals
 Inability to revitalize Balenciaga
 Inability to innovate around its primary brands
 Failure to integrate its acquisitions  further poor MA acquisitions
 Negative macro tailwinds
 Inability to innovate around ECommerce
 Supply chain issues
 Competitive pressure
 Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

In this scenario the fair value per share could be below 100share

The company seems solid especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI data centers and hybrid cloud which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025 They also stand to benefit from SMCIs issues and Nvidias Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech it feels like Dell could see steady longterm growth and break out to that 150 range by Q2 2024

1h0mqz8,Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting

 Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA

 Shares drop big time

 ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
proves them as lies One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETAs auditor but EY was never ZETAs auditor It was always Deloitte

 ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty

 Shares bounce back a bit

 Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician

 Shares drop this week again

Isnt it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks Or is the company the one that is corrupt

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future Is this case the same

What is your opinion on this Is it good entry point is it too risky to enter

Btw fundamentals of this company are good
Healthy growth nice debt ratio and management strong institutional ownership etc

1h0815y,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE Calif November 26 2024BUSINESS WIREAmerican allelectric automaker Rivian Automotive NASDAQ RIVN today announced it has received conditional commitment from the US Department of Energys Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing ATVM Loan Program for a loan of up to 66 billion including 6 billion of principal and approximately 600 million of capitalized interest to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design development and manufacturing in the United States

If finalized the loan would support the construction of Rivians next facility in Stanton Springs North near the city of Social Circle Georgia substantially expanding the companys domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the companys midsize platform which underpins the R2 a midsize SUV and the R3R3X a midsize crossover Designed engineered and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability function performance and pricing Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the companys longterm growth and profitability

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the US automotive industrial base enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases each resulting in 200000 units of annual production capacity for a total of 400000 units of annual capacitysupporting the sale of American EVs in international markets Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028 Rivian is expected to create approximately 7500 operations jobs through 2030 at the companys future manufacturing facility in Georgia This is in addition to 2000 expected fulltime construction jobs that will utilize the regions significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal Illinois which have bolstered the local and regional economy

This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen US leadership in EV manufacturing and technology said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our US manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability A robust ecosystem of US companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the US to maintain its longterm leadership in transportation

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site less than one hours drive from downtown Atlanta employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities

Over the history of the loan program DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry including loans to General Motors and Tesla

While this conditional commitment indicates DOEs intent to finance the project DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical legal environmental and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan If finalized the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company Rivian Automotive Inc and certain of its subsidiaries

1gzx5tr,"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Teslas electric vehicles likely would not qualify for Californias new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if Presidentelect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases Governor Gavin Newsoms office said on Monday
Tesla shares closed down 4

Trumps transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of 7500 for EV purchases Reuters reported this month

Tesla CEO Elon Musk a close Trump adviser sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California This is insane

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs oil and gas

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit he will propose creating a new version of the states Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent 149 billion to subsidize more than 594000 vehicles

The governors proposal for ZEV rebates and any potential market cap is subject to negotiation with the legislature Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition innovation and to support new market entrants the office said

California provided up to 7500 for the purchase or lease of a new plugin hybrid battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the states capandtrade program

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Teslas Fremont factory during the pandemic and Californias approval of a bill on transgender kids

In 2021 Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zeroemission vehicles doubling total sales since 2022

Last month a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the states plan to halt the sale of gasolineonly vehicles by 2035 a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism

My question is how is it that most years Ecopetrol stays profitable when it costs them 80 more to breakeven They have been profitable most years and still gain lots of venue how can petrobas not just lower prices remain profitable and chase them out What is keeping Ecopetrol around in this situation",stocks,Hiquirkykids,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732549863,0.9184,Positive,25,551

1gzfcoy,Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity with one exception and almost no one knows why because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isnt well understood by people who arent both habitual consumers and uptodate with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so

Its the following issue Lets say its 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high I light up a single 1 joint with my friend we smoke for 20 minutes and then were giggling We go to buy some twice a month or so A few years later its been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds to draw customers to them get market share and so on Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring places stuff

This is a race to the bottom Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff but you need far less of it to get the same high Habitual users spend less than 10 of what they used to on weed now everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition In addition you now have hash oil edibles dab pens tinctures you name it Not just regular flower

I never smoked much anyway but in the rare case I want a minivacation now I can take a vial of Tincture and put one drop under my tongue Within two hours the world is spinning Its so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month A single bottle of this costs about 65 and it comfortably lasts me an entire year This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business Its so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either No vapes pipes lighters etc The bottle comes with an eyedropper Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance I still rarely need to go out for more My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1100th the price we can get the same high now assuming one of us has a tincture or dab vape pen or edible or a newly exotic and potent strain at home

Compare this with alcohol where you cant make say vodka much stronger than it is Its impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because its physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than 97 I think and vodka is already around 45 and cant reasonably go much higher taste etc Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc

Or cigarettes where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery You cant just get a years supply of nicotine in a bottle because first of all itd be fatal with a slight dosage error you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 24 hours regardless of how much youre used to consuming assuming youre dependent on it to begin with of course And so it is a consistent business for sellers This is most true of cigarettes but also applies to vapes and pouches which have similarly excellent profit margins All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product

It is a subscription model in short while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone a very heavy user to boot has to go out and buy some and how much they spend Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot

The only exception to this Turning Point Brands TPB stock because they dont sell weed They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff Actual weed sellers do not because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products You cant sell 110th as much paper to people for the same effect or at least its less affected by this issue The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something Not sure how thatll work out Keep in mind this is a small cap company less than 1 billion in market cap reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector But its one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely Not sure how much more it can grow its probably overvalued now but in the past year or so its risen strongly

Otherwise Cronos and other weed stocks Bunk For the birds There might be an exception for medical marijuana CBD companies but thats pure conjecture as far as I know You can make condensed CBD products just the same",stocks,Sorry-Palpitation-70,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732528321,0.9966,Positive,44,5184

1gz0kgz,MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB LUNR and RDW and noone is mentioning MDA mktcap  32b CAD Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto eg IBKR Theyre planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off

Their earnings report was stellar growth of 38 yoy it is actually PROFITABLE  none of the other space companies are profitable  profitability with adjusted EBITDA of 555 million up 30 YoY and adjusted EBITDA margin of 197 net income up 60 yoy and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 08x so zero risk of dilution However post earnings the stock was mostly flat Why Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report backlog is 46B btw

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M  of these only 300M is recorded in backlog  an additional 450M is going to be added upon finalization and this will happen by years end They in fact stated during the QA that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with 5B backlog They also said MDAs satellite systems division alone has a 15B pipeline of potential projects thanks to its Auroraclass satellites tailored for low Earth orbit LEO constellations

Still not convinced Consider

 MDA is building a new 185000 sq ft facility in Quebec capable of producing two satellites per day starting in late 2025

Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year MDAs geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year However MDAs geo segment represents only about 20 of MDAs total revenue PLs marketcap is currently almost 1B MDA is 31 CAD  22B USD Oh and PL is currently operating at a loss though that might change next report but MDA is running a profit Based on this fact alone MDAs mkt cap should be at least double than what it is

1gywuwe,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleepingpartying on the weekend the following happened

 DoJ said Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
 prohibited from acquiring any interests in search rivals potential entrants and rival search or search adsrelated AI products
 halt all anticompetitive payments to distributors including Apple Samsung so that Google isnt the default search engine on their devices
 content creators can choose to optout of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp in 2001 the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows though this case ultimately resulted in a settlement With that in mind it is possible the DoJ will go this way this time

 Search is close to 50 revenue of Google Q3 results
 Browsers market shares Chrome 60 Safari 18 Edge 8 Source can be contested because its larger devices stats only
 Android  70 market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic It may have a few options up its sleeves





Chrome as a standalone listed company like Opera browserPossibly the worst move Average user unlikely to install a browseronly app than stick with factory default browser on the device 
ChromeGemini as a new company to command an AI valuationNot likely to attract advertisers until this new app gets wild ChatGPT like popularity 
AndroidChrome as a new company provides operating system for device manufacturersWont make sense because Samsung already has their prop version of Android And to gain search traffic Google again needs to partner with this new company which is prohibited
A company with personal suite of applications Gmail Calendar Docs and Chrome bundled togetherChrome then gets 100s million users from Day1 Still above legal prohibition remains 
SettlementMake it all go away

Any other speculations With so much uncertainty the stock will remain under pressure with downward bias until theres clarity on the case

But at PE 22 even if total revenue of the demerged companies takes a hit of 30 its still a great value",stocks,Straight_Turnip7056,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732470542,0.9399,Positive,70,2144

1gyd256,Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals

 Cash flow per share growth year over year
 Net profit margin growth year over year
 Lower longterm debt year over year

BUT ALSO HAS

 Lower revenue year over year
 Lower net income year over year
 Lower earnings per share year over year

In my opinion when revenue or net income is declining and not flat or increasing it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn Especially in a continued pattern of these results

However I often see companies with these symptoms sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year however the chart is very bullish at times

Thoughts Thanks in advance for your opinion

Edit Net profit margin growth vs typo of net income growth

Chrome Os is failing also Android might get antitrust

1gy4ckp,Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie 

Unfortunately I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small  mid cap mutual funds in December 2020 Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there but everything about the fund historical build up Morningstar ratings length of existence of the fund recommendations by publications YoY performance  etc led me to believe it was a reasonable if somewhat more aggressive investment  

It was all well and good for about a year as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy   Articles like this in the mainstream press lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism 

And then it did a capital gains distribution historically very normal for this fund in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet  Like overnight lost 15share  Similarly it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating  It continued to fall from there 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term  Since thenno 

  
Earlier this year Delaware merged a couple of their funds so DFDIX became IYMIX   As far as I can tell the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year the growths of this fund have been glacial   I realize that the holdings are small  mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost 

Ive literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways but actually halving of value  Thats never happened before 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small  midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive 

  
Im a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but its been really stressful  

Thanks in advance  And yes I realize I should have been using trailing stops but didnt so no lectures there please",stocks,Maccadawg,1970-01-01 00:00:01.732381515,0.9699,Positive,27,2428
